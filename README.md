# celulas_PHP

This project was created to attend churches that are organized in cells.

### PHP

PHP (a recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used, open source scripting language,
widely used, and especially suitable for web development and that can be embedded within HTML.
This projest was build with metodos that use what I call "static injection", it consists int keep a component 
top and bottom fixed end injecting a new content betwing them. PHP in this project is injecting HTML, CSS and 
javascript directto window throws ECHO, literally drawing the source code.

### JQuery

JQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and 
manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a 
multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that 
millions of people write JavaScript. Well, said that, I must tell you that although some people assuming that 
jquery isn't no longer appriated for developers. I used to put it on my projects.

### Javascript pure

This project couldn't leave use a pure function javascript. While,it whole code is end up converted in javascript 
it's no matter, but what really matters is the app does what we need its does. Librery javascript have linking 
from CDN, to keeping small and uptodate code.  


### Ajax

Similar ao Angular, ajax sincronized all code without refresh window, but a little bit more code to do that.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). In short; Ajax is about loading data in the background 
and display it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.
Examples of applications using AJAX: Gmail, Google Maps, Youtube, and Facebook tabs.

### CSS 

Bootstrap is part of my stuff and literally bring a beatty to it. A lot of ways to do something but withoud 
this library to me isn't a good idea. We must be quit in our work. Ever style in this job has a boostrap code.
