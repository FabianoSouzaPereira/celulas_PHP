#### This project was created to attend churches that are organized in cells.

## About what I've used in this project

### PHP

Recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a widely used, open source scripting language, widely used, and especially suitable for web development and that can be embedded within **HTML**. This projest was build with metodos that use what I call "static injection", it consists int keep a component 
top and bottom fixed end injecting a new content betwing them. **PHP** in this project is injecting  **HTML**, **CSS** and **javascript** directto window throws **ECHO**, literally drawing the source code.

### JQuery

Fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like **HTML** document traversal and 
manipulation, event handling, animation, and **Ajax** much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a 
multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, **jQuery** has changed the way that 
millions of people write **JavaScript**. Well, said that, I must tell you that although some people assuming that 
jquery isn't no longer appriated for developers. I used to put it on my projects.

### Javascript pure

This project couldn't leave use a pure function **javascript**. While,it whole code is end up converted in javascript 
it's no matter, but what really matters is the app does what we need its does. Librery javascript have linking 
from **CDN**, to keeping small and uptodate code.  


### Ajax

Similar ao Angular, ajax sincronized all code without refresh window, but a little bit more code to do that.
**Ajax** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). In short; **Ajax** is about loading data in the background 
and display it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.
Examples of applications using AJAX: **Gmail**, **Google Maps**, **Youtube**, and **Facebook tabs**.

### CSS 

**Bootstrap** is part of my stuff and literally bring a beatty to it. A lot of ways to do something but withoud 
this library to me isn't a good idea. We must be quit in our work. Ever style in this job has a **boostrap** code.

### Fonts Google 

Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized and 
streamlined throughout the design and engineering process.

### Material Google

I've got some icons from the google materals, because **Bootstrap 4.1** doesn't no longer accept **glyphicon icons**.
And a good option that I figure out was it and google stuff help a lot in all cases.
